# README

This site was generated using Hugo and the Blowfish theme.

## Development

* For local development with live reload, run
```sh
make dev
```

* For deployment, run
```
make build
```

This use the `hugo` command which builds your static site in /public -> deploy these files. It also cleans the /public directory since hugo does not do this by default.


## Deployment

The site is hosted on Github pages and deployed through [Github actions](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#build-hugo-with-github-action).
